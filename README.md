A basic 2D Unity game done for Mobile Apps 3. We had to design a game and provide some sprites for said game. We were then randomly given a person to give our game design document to while getting one from another. This was interesting as we didn't get to design our own game making it more challenging as we didn't neccesarily get to make what we already knew.

The game itself is a platform puzzler. You are required to complete puzzles using the character to progress to the next level. The reward system of the game isfiguring out the puzzle needed for each scene. The 'gotcha' part of the game is it is possible for the player to put the game into an unwinnable situation. This is why the level can be reset at any time.
